# congressional_tweets_project_code_istanbul

This is a README file that explains the steps that we followed for the Kaggle project in order of that the notebooks ran.

## Method 1) Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### svm.ipynb

This is the notebook wehere we process the hashtags column with tfidf method and then, apply classification using SVM. The accuracy returned by Kaggle is 0.85501.

## Method 2) Logistic Regression with ElasticNet

## prepare_data.ipynb

This is the notebook that prepares X_train.csv, y_train.csv, X_test.csv and Id.csv files to be fed into the notebooks running the main classification methods.

## logistic_regression_elasticnet.ipynb

The notebook where we apply logistic regression without cross validation with ElasticNet.

## Method 3) BERT

## Older versions of the codes

### kaggle_preprocess.py
Preprocessing'i yaptigimiz ve BlueHive uzerinden run ettigimiz kod.

### congressional_tweets_project_code_istanbul.ipynb
Kodun orijinal hali ayni zamanda logistic regression da yapilan kod.
